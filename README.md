## Complete React Tutorial (& Redux)

Learning React from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxIDLw0M-m0&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9ij8CfkAY2RAGb-tmkNwQHG"> Youtube video series </a> by Net Ninja.

This is an old series (6 years) but I guess is ok for learning the basics.
Note: `create-react-app` is depricated.


### Lesson 1 and 2
Introduces the concept of React and virtual DOM.

### Lesson 3
- Starts from a simple html boiler plate.
- React CDN
- VS code extensions for productivity (`ES7`, `sublime babel`, `Monokai++`)

### Lesson 4
Creating a basic component in react

<b> JSX </b> : a way to write html code in <b>JS</b> <br> </br>

Limitations of JSX:
- 1 root element at the top
- class keyword cannot be used for CSS -> `className` is used instead
- JSX is not supported in browser out of the box

so we need to add babel script from `babel CDN`
